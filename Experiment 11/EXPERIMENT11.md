## 📝 Introduction & Theory

### The Shift to Digital
While previous experiments focused on analog transmission, commercial communications are rapidly shifting to digital transmission. A primary reason for this transition is the superior resistance of digital signals to electrical noise interference.

### The Sampling Process
To transmit an analog message (like speech or music) via a digital system, it must first be converted to digital[cite: 10]. This process is called **sampling**, which involves measuring the analog signal's voltage at regular intervals.

Mathematically, sampling is defined as the multiplication of the message signal with the sampling signal:
> **Sampled message = The sampling signal $\times$ The message**

Since the sampling signal consists of a DC voltage and many sinewaves (fundamental and harmonics), the equation expands to:
> **Sampled message = (DC + fundamental + harmonics) $\times$ message**

This results in a spectrum containing:
* A sinewave at the message frequency[cite: 34].
* Pairs of sinewaves representing the sum and difference of the fundamental and message frequencies.
* Many other pairs representing the sum and difference of the sampling harmonics and the message.

### Reconstruction
To recover the original message, the sampled signal is passed through a **Low-Pass Filter (LPF)**. This filter allows the lower frequency signals (the original message) to pass while rejecting the higher frequency components generated by the sampling process.

## 🔬 Part A: Sampling a Simple Message

In this section, you will use the **Dual Analog Switch** module to sample a simple 2kHz sinewave message.

### Natural Sampling

**Procedure:**
1.  Gather the required equipment.
2.  Connect the setup to sample a 2kHz sine wave using an 8kHz digital control signal.
    * **Message:** 2kHz SINE output from Master Signals[cite: 72].
    * **Control:** 8kHz DIGITAL output from Master Signals[cite: 73].
3.  Ensure the oscilloscope Trigger Source is set to **CH1** (or INT) and Mode is set to **CH1**.
4.  View the signals in **DUAL** mode to compare the message and the sampled output.

**Block Diagram Output:**

**Analysis:**
* **Type of Sampling:** This is an example of **Natural Sampling**.
* **Visual Confirmation:**
    1.  The sample voltages change *during* the sampling window.
    2.  The signal's voltage returns to zero volts between samples.

### Sample-and-Hold Scheme

**Procedure:**
1.  ]Modify the setup to use the Sample-and-Hold (S/H) function of the Dual Analog Switch.
2.  Maintain the same message (2kHz sine) and control (8kHz digital) signals.
3.  **Do not** pull apart the entire existing wiring; simply switch the connections to the Dual Analog Switch to substitute the switch for the S/H circuit as indicated.

**Analysis:**
* **Visual Confirmation:**
    1.  The sample voltages **do not change** during sampling.
    2.  There is **no space** (zero voltage return) between the samples.

## 🗣 Part B: Sampling Speech

Commercial systems typically transmit speech or music rather than pure sine waves.

**Procedure:**
1.  Disconnect the Master Signals 2kHz SINE output.
2.  Connect the **Speech module's output** as the message source.
3.  Set the scope's Timebase to **2ms/div**.
4.  Talk, sing, or hum while observing the scope display to see the sampled speech signal.

## 🔄 Part C: Reconstructing a Sampled Message

Reconstruction involves recovering the original message from the sampled data. Since the sampled signal contains a sinewave at the exact frequency of the original message, we can use a **Low-Pass Filter** to isolate it.

**Procedure:**
1.  Return the scope Timebase to **0.1ms/div**.
2.  Locate the **Tuneable Low-pass Filter** module.
    * Set **Gain** to the middle position.
    * Turn **Cut-off Frequency Adjust** fully anti-clockwise.
3.  Disconnect the Speech module and return to the Setup shown in the figure below.

**Wiring Diagram Setup:**

By adjusting the filter, you should be able to reject the high-frequency sampling components and observe the reconstructed sine wave.
